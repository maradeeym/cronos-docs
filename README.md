## What is Cronos?

Cronos (cronos.org) is a leading blockchain ecosystem that has partnered with Crypto.com and more than 500 application developers and contributors representing an addressable user base of more than a hundred million people around the world. Cronos' mission is to make it easy and safe for the next billion crypto users to adopt self-custody in Web3, with a focus on Decentralized Finance and Gaming.

The Cronos universe encompasses 3 chains: **Cronos EVM**, the leading Ethereum-compatible blockchain built on the Cosmos SDK; **Cronos POS**, a leading Cosmos chain for payments and NFTs; and **Cronos zkEVM**, a new high performance layer 2 network secured by Ethereum.

Cronos ranks among the top 15 blockchain ecosystems, encompassing more than 6 billion dollars of user assets. Since inception, it has securely settled more than 100 million transactions.

Transaction fees are paid in Cronos ($CRO), a blue chip cryptocurrency.

Cronos is supported by Cronos Labs, a Web3 start-up accelerator focused on DeFi, GameFi, and the development of the Cronos ecosystem.

## Why build on Cronos EVM?

If you are a Web3 application creator, there are 3 main reasons to build on Cronos:

* EVM compatible – Solidity and all the EVM tools just work out of the box.
* Strategic partnership with [Crypto.com](http://crypto.com/) – easy on-ramp to your dapp.
* \#CROFam - a highly engaged user and builder community of >100 million people worldwide, who are keen to try the latest and greatest apps.

As an application founder/developer on Cronos, you can leverage:

* Wrapped versions of most of the world’s top 50 cryptocurrencies
* 30+ leading wallets (including Crypto.com Defi Wallet, Rabby, MetaMask, Trust Wallet)
* Ethermint, a Ethereum Virtual Machine module built by the open-source Cosmos SDK community.
* IBC cross-chain connectivity to Cosmos chains.
* Convenient Ethereum developer tools (Solidity, Truffle, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Web3.js, ethers.js, ChainSafe Gaming SDK, etc.).
* [Cronos Play](https://cronos.org/play), a suite of developer tools for web, Unity, Unreal and C++ game developers.

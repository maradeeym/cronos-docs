# Cronos zkEVM

## Introducing Cronos zkEVM Testnet

In December 2023, [Cronos Labs](https://cronoslabs.org), the web3 start-up accelerator focusing on DeFi, GameFi, and the development of the [Cronos](https://cronos.org) ecosystem, announced the launch of Cronos zkEVM Chain public testnet, a zero-knowledge (ZK) layer 2 blockchain network that represents a significant milestone on Cronos' journey towards scalability and mainstream adoption.

The testnet is a chain using [ZK Stack](https://zkstack.io/), launched in a partnership between Cronos Labs, Matter Labs, the team behind [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), and engineering teams from [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com), [VVS Finance](https://vvs.finance/), [Fulcrom Finance](https://fulcrom.finance/en/) and [Veno Finance](https://veno.finance/).

# Web3-wallet

As browser injected wallets (Rabby, MetaMask, Trust Wallet), Crypto.com DeFi Wallet and WalletConnect use somewhat different front-end integration frameworks, it can be challenging for a developer to integrate all types of wallets with standardized code.

The open-source Web3-wallet package is used by many of the top dapps on Cronos, and makes it easy to do this in Typescript.

You can review the Web3-wallet documentation here: [https://web3-wallet.github.io/web3-wallet/docs/getting-started](https://web3-wallet.github.io/web3-wallet/docs/getting-started)

The following example project uses NextJS (version 13+) and Web3-wallet to demonstrate a simple dapp that integrates well with the top Cronos-compatible wallets: [https://github.com/kentimsit/cronos-wallet-connections-v3](https://github.com/kentimsit/cronos-wallet-connections-v3)

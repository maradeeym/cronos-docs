# Background

## Cronos

The Cronos Mainnet was launched on 8 November 2021.

Cronos is the leading EVM-compatible chain build on the Cosmos SDK.

Cronos aims to massively scale DeFi and GameFi by providing developers with the ability to rapidly port dApps from Ethereum and EVM-Compatible chains, while also benefiting from the multi-chain thesis of the Cosmos ecosystem.

Cronos is powered by the Cronos ($CRO) cryptocurrency for the payment of transaction fees. Cronos runs separately from the [Cronos POS Chain](https://cronos-pos.org/), a Cosmos proof-of-stake chain also powered by $CRO.

## Ethermint

Cronos is powered by the open-source project [Ethermint](https://github.com/evmos/ethermint), which allows for the rapid porting of smart contracts from Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains.

The Inter Blockchain Communications (IBC) protocol enables interoperability and bridging between Cronos and the Crypto.org Chain as well as other Cosmos chain.

## Key features of Cronos technology

#### **EVM-compatible**

Application developers can use Solidity, the leading EVM-compatible language for smart contracts, as well as the broad range of Ethereum developer tools and open-source libraries.

#### **Scalable**

The Tendermint consensus is robust, fast and cheap. The Cronos validator node ecosystem is carbon neutral, owing to low energy consumption which is further offset by the purchase of carbon credits.

#### **Interoperable**

Cronos is EVM-compatible and interoperable with other Cosmos chains.

IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to communicate with each other, interoperate and transfer value, interchange assets and services, and connect without running into the scaling issues inherent in some of the largest blockchains today.

#### Ecosystem

The Cronos protocol engineering team contributes actively to open-source projects of the Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystem.

Through its strategic partnership with Crypto.com, a leading custodial crypto platform, Cronos can leverage easy on-ramp and access for an addressable user community of more than 70 million users worldwide.

## Ecosystem support

Cronos Labs supports the growth of the Cronos developer ecosystem through various programs.

The Cronos Ecosystem Grants program aims to support early-stage projects on Cronos by bootstrapping initial product development and providing technical support. Please visit the [Cronos grants page](https://cronos.org/grants) and [Cronos's Medium page](https://medium.com/cronos-chain) for more details.

The Cronos Accelerator is another notable program targeted at promising application creators. Please visit the [Cronos accelerator page](https://cronos.org/accelerators) for more details.
